I first made a function that generates random states from our list of states. It then gets the population of each state and represents them as circles in a window where the area of the window is the total population of the country. Each state is given a circle of a certain color. The program will tell you what color is what state. Obviously the larger the population, the larger the circles will be, and the smaller the populations, the smaller the circles will be. My next function does the same thing as the last, except now we get to choose the states. The states must be spelled properly for it to work. They're all capitalized, and spaces must be included for state names that have two parts like "New York".
